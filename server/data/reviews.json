I attempted to change it again, and surprisingly, TikTok let me—even though there’s normally a 30-day limit between username changes. At one point, both usernames seemed to be somehow linked to my account.\n\nWhen I tried to get help, I had to go through their AI chatbot, which was completely useless. It didn’t even consider that the problem might be on TikTok’s side. So I emailed TikTok support directly—no response. Nothing.\n\nEventually, I gave up and tried using a completely different username. As soon as I did, TikTok suspended my account—for absolutely no clear reason.\n\nThis was an incredibly frustrating experience, and their support system is practically nonexistent. Really disappointing.",

For a lot of people the search bar content contains a lot of thirst trap of low value females (I said what I said because that what they are). A lot of porn shows a up in a lot of peoples search bars when you’re simply looking up something such as “boiling water” “how to” videos or simply clicking on the blue search comments to take you to something relevant to what you were watching on your fyp. There is a lot of MEN posting inappropriate tik toks of women, very predatory content, a loooot of pedos following UNDER AGE children on this app as well. And of course tik tok doesn’t absolutely NOTHING about it these disgusting individuals. You report all these things and Tik tok straight up says there is no issues, but GOD FORBID you speak at all on comments, use any type of emojis or put someone in their place for being racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic because YOU get your comments removed for “violating community guidelines” but not all those posts porn and such other hateful things? And no, do not sit there and say “oh well what are you looking up” because majority of these sickos use every hashtag for relevancy so that it pops up NO MATTER WHAT YOURE LOOKING UP! I thought tik tok was all about protecting children? That’s how we protect them? By letting these sick, demented, porn addicts expose themselves to kids?? WEIRD! TIK TOK YALL ARE WEIRD!!! And I’m glad you are getting banned because you  are a fvckn JOKE of an app!",

		"title": "Wow",
		"content": "TikTok is, without a doubt, one of the most innovative, entertaining, and culturally influential social media platforms of the modern digital era, and it continues to evolve and dominate online spaces in 2025 with no signs of slowing down. Since its explosion in popularity a few years ago, TikTok has fundamentally changed how people interact with content, shifting attention from long-form consumption to short, punchy, addictive videos that cater perfectly to fast-paced lifestyles and shorter attention spans. One of the platform’s most praised features is its incredibly intelligent algorithm, which learns what you like with jaw-dropping accuracy—even after just a few minutes of scrolling—and creates a feed (the For You Page, or FYP) that is uniquely tailored to your interests. Whether you’re into comedy, anime, cooking, gaming, aesthetics, dancing, fashion, makeup, horror stories, nostalgic edits, psychology facts, cleaning videos, chaotic memes, life hacks, productivity tips, or something super niche like frog memes or obscure historical facts, TikTok will find it and serve it up faster than any other app ever has. Unlike many other social media platforms that focus heavily on follower count or curated feeds, TikTok levels the playing field by giving virtually anyone the chance to go viral—even users with zero followers—simply by posting something clever, relatable, or engaging. This has opened the door for countless creators and small businesses to gain visibility, grow audiences, and build careers they never imagined possible, all from their phones. The in-app video editor is intuitive yet shockingly powerful, making it easy to add effects, music, filters, captions, and transitions without needing external tools or any prior editing experience. Combined with the massive library of trending sounds, memes, and songs, the barrier to entry for content creation is incredibly low while the potential for creativity is sky-high.\n\nTikTok’s community aspect is also something special. It’s not just an app to watch videos—it’s a living ecosystem of trends, inside jokes, duets, stitches, collabs, debates, and responses that all feed into a culture of participation and creativity. From “Corecore” edits that explore digital emotions, to “Storytime” creators who share the most outrageous or heartfelt life experiences, to “POV” actors bringing characters to life with surprising depth, TikTok encourages users to be bold, weird, honest, funny, or whatever else they feel like being. Whole subcultures thrive within the app—whether it’s “BookTok,” where authors and readers boost novels into bestsellers, “CleanTok,” where people watch satisfying organizing videos for relaxation, or “AltTok,” which leans into offbeat, surreal humor. These digital communities form naturally and are surprisingly welcoming, making the app feel like more than just entertainment—it becomes a space to belong. TikTok also pushes boundaries in education, with teachers, scientists, therapists, and other professionals using the platform to break down complex topics in ways that are digestible and interesting. You can literally learn a new language, explore history, or understand mental health better—just from scrolling your feed. That balance of fun and learning is something few platforms have managed to nail.\n\nAnother powerful part of TikTok is how deeply it influences trends, both online and in real life. Entire fashion movements, catchphrases, beauty products, and music careers have been born from TikTok. It’s the app where new slang spreads, where viral challenges begin, and where cultural moments happen. Major brands, celebrities, and even politicians now use the platform to connect with audiences, proving its place as a mainstream powerhouse. Music, in particular, has seen a huge impact—countless songs have gone from obscure to chart-topping hits just because they were used in a viral TikTok. Some artists now design songs specifically to hit on TikTok, focusing on catchy intros or lyrics that people can dance or lip-sync to. Beyond music, the platform also gives a massive voice to people from all backgrounds, often boosting creators from marginalized communities in a way that feels more authentic than traditional media. It helps amplify stories that matter, raise awareness about social issues, and shine a light on voices that are often overlooked. Whether you want to laugh, cry, vibe, rant, learn, or just feel less alone, there is a corner of TikTok that’s perfect for you—and it will find you.\n\nTikTok is also incredibly fun and satisfying to use, with constant updates, seasonal trends, themed filters, and even live streams that bring more interactivity to the app. Unlike other social platforms that can feel toxic or overly curated, TikTok thrives on relatability and authenticity. People don’t need to look perfect or have expensive equipment—sometimes the rawest, most unfiltered content does the best. And while every app has its flaws, TikTok’s ability to unite entertainment, expression, education, and connection in one sleek experience is unmatched. Whether you’re a casual scroller or an ambitious creator, the app constantly offers new things to try, trends to follow, and laughs to be had. In short, TikTok isn’t just an app—it’s a full-on cultural universe that has become part of how people express themselves, discover new ideas, connect with others, and shape the world around them. It’s creative, chaotic, clever, and constantly changing, and for anyone who loves being part of something bigger, TikTok is absolutely worth the hype.",

It has now been a year and a half since I got it and I absolutely adore the app. If you struggle to believe if you need this app or not, read the reviews fully! And if you change your mind great!

I was really confused to see that I got a notification that I had been age restricted, flagging my profile as “Under 16 years of age.” Submit an appeal it offer, so I did. 3 times now of providing my state issued ID proving that I am 19 years old. Even me holding up a combination of letters on a piece of paper with me ID and face in frame. All have been denied. I submit 2 help tickets - one got closed with no solution and barely any communication and the other has not been gotten back to in 5 days. I even emailed their support, to which they told me to submit ANOTHER appeal via their link - so I did. No avail. This is ridiculous, poor customer service, and awful communication.",

Like… this app is for 12+ and apparently im under 18-16 like.. also not that, I made my second account April 2024, it got banned yesterday because im apparently under 16. I made my third account yesterday, it got banned even though I didn’t post anything. TikTok, you got downgrades. Why are you doing this? Im 13, I may be short so? There are girls out there that are also short and you don’t ban them. I may look young but I didn’t even show my face and also I’m 13, again this app is for 12+. I didn’t even get a chance to save my old videos, your so messed up. You report/ban me for posting dumps that doesn’t even show my face and it shows a beautiful sunset. But you don’t ban people who say potty words on TikTok? Oh so you’re allowed to curse but not post sunset pictures. You’re so weird. I used to watch TikTok a lot because I always get bored but TikTok took my boredom away. Im so frustrated. TikTok was half of my life singing and dancing in 2020 and now, yiu ban 3 of my accounts? For what? Not even funny because in the 3rd account i didn’t even post anything but you still banned me. My account usernames are : 1st: deeadgirllifee : 2nd: swirlygirlgrace : 3rd: ilovecookies.hi : you’re so messed up and I want to appeal because I want either of these accounts back.

Though I of course love the app TikTok, I have realized there have been quite a few changes to the UI that make certain parts of this app become genuinely aggravating and unbearable. More specifically, the linking to Instagram. They keep updating it yet. It seems that the updates don't do anything but Americanize it yet not make it better. There's a glitch in trying to link your Instagram in your TikTok bio, yet if you click someone's link and it leads you to Instagram, TikTok will not let you export the link to Safari. It will just force you to use the website in the app, which is weird and feels like some type of invasion of privacy. Other things have been done to the UI like the sensitivity when sliding in between because they obviously really want you to use TikTok shop and how overbearing the TikTok shop push is on the For You page. I try to actively avoid any video that has TikTok shop linked even if I do want to see",

The only thing I would like is when I make a collection for certain types of videos and stuff, could you add a shuffle mode so that when I open a collection, I watch the videos within that collection in a random order, and not the order that I added them. Obviously, you can also keep the current method to watch them, I would think it would be nice to have a shuffle button and a normal watching button. Thanks.",

		"title": "Horrible Support Team",
		"content": "It’s unacceptable that it takes weeks for users to receive meaningful feedback from a support team. With the high volume of users on this app, responses should be prompt and genuinely helpful. Even with AI, a free or affordable app offering AI functionality outperforms TikTok’s support by a wide margin.\nI was previously suspended for being “underage,” despite meeting the age requirements in the guidelines, which left me confused and frustrated. Submitting an appeal, which shouldn’t have been necessary, took days for the support team to address. After regaining access to my account, I noticed my DM and gifting permissions on live streams were restricted. I realized I had accidentally entered the wrong birth year during age verification.\nExpecting a proper resolution, I submitted a ticket explaining the mistake in my date of birth and requested a correction. Days passed with no response. I submitted multiple additional requests and even emailed the feedback team, which responded after hours—only to receive another AI-generated reply addressing an entirely different issue. I responded clearly, stating:\n“I’ve submit an appeal, and it’s not about a ban. It’s about changing my date of birth, as I have chosen the wrong year (––) while I was born in ––. This has caused me to lose my DM access, and I have submit multiple ignored tickets about that issue. I would like actual help, as I feel it’s just being ignored.”\nFor privacy, I’ve omitted the specific years here, but I included them in the email. The response I received was:\n“Hi there,\nThanks for contacting TikTok.\nWe understand how important your account is to you, so we thank you for your patience!\nAfter careful review, there are no current violations of our Community Guidelines and you should have full access to your account.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience, and thank you again for your patience. Happy TikTok’ing!\nBest, The TikTok Team.”\nThis response was irrelevant and infuriating. Continuously submitting tickets, hoping for a human response, only to be met with an ineffective AI system is unacceptable. TikTok needs to prioritize timely, accurate, and human-driven support to resolve user issues effectively.",

It’s genuinely so annoying. It’s not the first time i’ve had this happen either. Videos also get stuck uploading and sent to drafts over and over again. I’m getting the same videos i’ve seen on my fyp over and over, videos i’ve already liked. While videos made by my mutuals show up and swipe themselves before i can even watch or like them, and I have to them navigate to their profile. Given the fact that the algorithm is looking for watch time, that probably also damages their videos getting less than 1 second of viewing for no reason.",

Mindel’s self-identified role as a 'proud Zionist' and her background as an Israeli military instructor create a direct conflict of interest for a position overseeing content moderation in a region where:*  \n\u003e - *Palestinian voices are routinely suppressed under claims of 'hate speech' or 'antisemitism,'*  \n\u003e - *Content criticizing Israel is disproportionately censored.*  \n\u003e   \n\u003e *Hiring someone with explicit ties to an occupying military — during an ongoing genocide — undermines TikTok’s claimed neutrality. Users demand transparency: How will Mindel ensure Palestinian perspectives on occupation, resistance, and war crimes are not silenced as 'hate speech'?

It said that my account would be banned in 30 days because I didn’t meet the age requirements for TikTok, although I’m over the age required. This had never been a problem before, so I obviously checked it out and proved my age. After I proved my age, it sign me into my alt account. I went to switch back to my main account, but it wasn’t there so I had to log back in to it. It then made me verify my age again on that account. When I checked the system updates, it said that my account had been permanently banned for multiple violations of their guidelines, but I had been following every rule. I can no longer send videos to my friends unless it’s through text messages, and I also cannot chat on the app. Overall, the app is good but I’m confused on why I got a permanent ban?",

These children can be easily influenced by whatever they see because they don't understand. Such as misinformation, harming content, offensive language, and so much more. Please, if you are a parent, stop making your kids watch TikTok or any kind of doomscrolling apps like Instagram, YouTube Shorts, etc. Make your kids GO outside not doomscrolling you irresponsible parents, who let their kids have this app or stay on their devices all day.",

It makes it hard to find the effects I want to use.\n\nI’ve tried restarting the app, clearing the cache, and even switching internet connections, but nothing fixes it. I hope this can be fixed soon because otherwise, I really love the app!\n\nThanks TikTok team 💖",
